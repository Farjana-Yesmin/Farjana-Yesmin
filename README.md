### About Me

I'm a researcher with extensive experience in Bioinformatics, Data Science, and AI. My passion lies in building machine learning models that are not only accurate but also fair, interpretable, and privacy-preserving, particularly for healthcare applications like human activity recognition, disease prediction, and medical imaging.

- üî¨ **Current Research:** Fairness-aware representation learning, multimodal deep learning, and federated learning.
- üìù **I'm currently writing** several papers under review for top-tier conferences and journals.
- ü§ù **I'm looking to collaborate on** projects involving trustworthy AI, healthcare ML, and biosignal analysis.
- üí¨ **Ask me about:** Machine Learning, Deep Learning, AI Fairness, Federated Learning, Healthcare AI.
- ‚ö° **Fun fact:** I'm a runner and have completed a 5k!
